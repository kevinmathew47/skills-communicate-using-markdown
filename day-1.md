# Silly Story Generator

This project is a fun, interactive Silly Story Generator that allows users to create random, humorous stories by entering custom names and choosing between US and UK units for temperature and weight.

## How it works

1. **Enter Custom Name**: Users can enter a custom name in the text field provided.
2. **Select Unit**: Users can choose between US or UK units using the radio buttons.
3. **Generate Story**: Users click the "Generate random story" button to create a new random silly story.

The story text will be updated based on the custom name and unit preferences chosen by the user.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for generating the silly stories.
- `styles.css`: (Optional) You can include a CSS file for additional styling, if needed.
